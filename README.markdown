# Notes

- This addon is largely unchanged from saiket's efforts!
- I am a documentation guy, not a programmer.  It is unlikely I can make any real changes.
  -  If you are a developer, I am happy to:
     -  Accept GitHub pull requests.
     -  Add you as a contributor on GitHub.
     -  Hand this project over!

# Issues and suggestions

([issues list](https://github.com/spiralofhope/_DevPad/issues))

- If you seen an error, disable all addons but this one and re-test before creating an issue.
  -  If you have multiple addons installed, errors you think are for one addon may actually be for another.  No really, disable everything else.
- Search for your issue before creating an issue.
- Always report errors.
  -  There are several helpful addons to catch errors.  Try something like [TekErr](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6681).
