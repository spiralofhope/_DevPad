### Problems

- If you seen an error, disable all addons but this one and re-test before creating an issue.
  -  If you have multiple addons installed, errors you think are for one addon may actually be for another.  No really, disable everything else.
- Search through [the issues list](https://github.com/spiralofhope/_DevPad/issues) before creating an issue.
- Always quote errors.
  -  There are several helpful addons to catch errors.  Try something like TekErr ([github](https://github.com/TekNoLogic/tekErr) &middot;  [wowinterface](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6681) &middot; [curse](https://mods.curse.com/project/103101) &middot; [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/projects/103101/))
- Do your best to give the exact steps you took to reproduce your problem.
  -  If this is only an occasional or unpredictable problem, then you'll need to do your best to give your opinion.
