I dunno, I haven't thought about a license.  Some things can't be copyrighted or are lifted from random code out there on the 'net.  Some things don't really matter anyway.  Other things I'd like credit for.

So it's all basically "all rights reserved" and whatnot.

You can probably do what you want, but check in with me if it's for significant use like redistribution or for commercial/government/military/etc use.

If you use anything, get a hold of me with changes you make; I'd like to improve my stuff.

Maybe you can convince my lazy ass to bother with this.
